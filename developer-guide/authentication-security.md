# Authentication & Security
This guide details how authentication and security are implemented in the Matra platform.

## Authentication Flow
1. **User Registration**
   - Email verification
   - Password requirements (min 8 chars, includes special chars)
   - Optional 2FA setup

2. **JWT-based Authentication**
   - Tokens expire after 24 hours
   - Refresh token mechanism for seamless experience
   - Blacklisting of compromised tokens

3. **2FA Implementation**
   - Email-based verification codes
   - Future: Google Authenticator integration
   - Required for sensitive operations (large transfers, vendor functions)

## API Security
- All API endpoints are protected with HTTPS
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- IP-based restrictions for suspicious activity
- Input validation on all endpoints

## Wallet Security
- Self-custodial model - private keys never leave the device
- AES-256 encryption for local storage
- Biometric authentication support (where available)
- Automatic session timeouts

## Developer Best Practices
- Never store API keys in client-side code
- Implement proper error handling
- Use webhook verification
- Keep SDK and libraries updated
