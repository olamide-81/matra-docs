# Authentication & Security
This internal documentation details the authentication and security implementation in the Matra platform.

## Authentication Flow
1. **User Registration**
   - Email verification system
   - No passwords required - we use email-based verification only
   - Email addresses are only collected for notifications and P2P transaction verification

2. **Email-based Authentication**
   - Verification codes sent to email
   - Codes expire after 6 minutes
   - One-time use codes for added security

3. **2FA Implementation**
   - Email-based verification codes for P2P transactions only
   - Future: Optional Google Authenticator integration (in roadmap for Q3)
   - Used only for high-value or sensitive operations

## API Security Implementation
- All API endpoints protected with HTTPS
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per minute per IP
- IP-based restrictions for suspicious activity detection
- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints

## Wallet Security Architecture
- Self-custodial model - private keys never leave the device
- AES-256 encryption for local storage
- Biometric authentication support on supported devices
- Automatic session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity

## Email Usage Policy
Our internal policy regarding email usage:

- Emails are collected only for notifications and 2FA for P2P transactions
- No marketing emails without explicit opt-in from users
- Email addresses are stored using AES-256 encryption
- Email verification ensures account ownership

## Development Guidelines
For internal developers:

- Never store API keys in client-side code
- Implement proper error handling with sanitized error messages
- Use webhook verification with HMAC signatures
- Keep all SDK and libraries updated to latest secure versions
