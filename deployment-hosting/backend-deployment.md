- Development: Basic development environment

## Server Setup Process

Standard server configuration includes security hardening and necessary software installation.

## Deployment Architecture

Our backend services are deployed in containers with proper security and scaling measures.

## Deployment Process

Our deployment workflow uses automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Database Management

Database is hosted on a managed database service with appropriate scaling tiers for each environment.

## SSL Configuration

Production environments use SSL certificates with auto-renewal.
