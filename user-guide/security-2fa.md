# Security & 2FA
Matra prioritizes the security of your assets with multiple layers of protection.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Matra currently supports email-based two-factor authentication:

1. Enable 2FA in the app settings.
2. You will receive a verification code via email when performing critical actions.
3. Enter the verification code to complete sensitive operations.

*Note: Google Authenticator integration is coming soon.*

## Securing Your Wallet
- **Recovery Phrase**: Always keep your 12-word recovery phrase secure and offline.
- **App PIN/Biometrics**: Set up a PIN code or use biometric authentication (fingerprint/Face ID) for app access.
- **Automatic Logout**: The app automatically logs out after a period of inactivity.

## Security Best Practices
- Never share your recovery phrase or private keys with anyone.
- Be cautious of phishing attempts - always verify you're using the official Matra app.
- Enable all available security features.
- Regularly update the app to ensure you have the latest security patches.
