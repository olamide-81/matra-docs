## Security Considerations

<div class="callout warning">
  <h4>Web Dashboard Security</h4>
  <p>While the web dashboard is designed with security in mind, always follow these best practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Only access the dashboard from trusted devices and secure networks</li>
    <li>Always verify the connection on your mobile device before approving</li>
    <li>Check that you're on the official domain (web.matra.io) before scanning any QR codes</li>
    <li>Sign out when you're finished using the dashboard, especially on shared computers</li>
    <li>Never share your screen while the dashboard is showing sensitive information</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Session Management

Your web dashboard session remains active as long as you're actively using it. However, for security reasons:

- Sessions automatically time out after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Closing your browser will end the session
- You can manually log out by clicking the "Sign Out" button in the account menu

<div class="callout tip">
  <p>If you need to use the web dashboard on a different computer, you can simply sign out on your current device and repeat the connection process on the new device.</p>
</div>

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If you encounter issues connecting to the web dashboard:

1. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes a simple refresh can resolve connection issues
2. **Check your internet connection** - Both your mobile device and computer need stable internet
3. **Update your mobile app** - Ensure you're using the latest version of the Matra app
4. **Clear browser cache** - Cached data might interfere with the connection process
5. **Try a different browser** - If issues persist, try using a different web browser
6. **Check mobile permissions** - Ensure the Matra app has camera permissions for QR scanning

If problems continue, contact Matra support through the mobile app or at support@matra.io.
