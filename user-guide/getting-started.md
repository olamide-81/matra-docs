## Securing Your Recovery Phrase

<div class="callout danger">
  <p><strong>CRITICAL:</strong> Your recovery phrase is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose access to your device or forget your password. Matra cannot recover your wallet for you if you lose your recovery phrase.</p>
</div>

When you create your wallet, you'll be shown a 12-word recovery phrase. Follow these steps to secure it:

1. Write down your recovery phrase on paper in the correct order
2. Store this paper in a secure, waterproof, and fireproof location
3. Consider creating multiple backup copies stored in different secure locations
4. Never store your recovery phrase digitally (no photos, no digital documents, no cloud storage)
5. Never share your recovery phrase with anyone, including Matra support

## Navigating the App
