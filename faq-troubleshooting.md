# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## General Questions

### What is Matra?
Matra is a decentralized P2P and self-custodial wallet available on iOS and Android. It allows users to create a self-custodial wallet and enables vendors to facilitate P2P transactions globally.

### Is Matra available in my country?
Matra is available globally, but P2P vendor services may be limited in certain regions due to regulatory requirements. Check the app for a list of supported countries for vendor services.

### How does Matra ensure security?
Matra employs several security measures including self-custodial wallet architecture (your keys, your coins), email-based 2FA (with Google Authenticator coming soon), encrypted local storage, and PIN/biometric protection.

## Wallet Issues

### I forgot my password. How can I recover my account?
Matra accounts can be recovered using your 12-word recovery phrase. If you've lost both your password and recovery phrase, unfortunately, we cannot help you recover your account since we don't store your private keys.

### My transaction has been pending for a long time. What should I do?
Blockchain transactions can sometimes take longer due to network congestion. For most networks, transactions should complete within 30-60 minutes. If it's been longer, check the transaction ID on a blockchain explorer to verify its status.

### Why can't I see my tokens in my wallet?
If you recently transferred tokens to your wallet, they may take some time to appear. If tokens are still missing:
1. Ensure you're looking at the correct wallet address
2. Verify the transaction was completed on a blockchain explorer
3. Refresh your wallet by pulling down on the main screen
4. Check if the token is supported by Matra

## P2P Trading

### How do I become a vendor?
To become a vendor, go to the P2P section in the app and select "Become a Vendor." You'll need to complete KYC verification and meet minimum requirements for account age and transaction history.

### A vendor isn't releasing my funds. What should I do?
If you've completed payment but the vendor hasn't released your funds, use the in-app dispute resolution system:
1. Open the transaction details
2. Click "Raise Dispute"
3. Provide proof of payment
4. Support will intervene to resolve the issue

### Is there a fee for P2P transactions?
Matra charges a small fee of 0.5% for P2P transactions. This fee is built into the exchange rate you see when creating a transaction.

## Swap Issues

### Why is the exchange rate different from what I see on other platforms?
Exchange rates on Matra are provided by ChangeNOW and include their service fees. Rates may also fluctuate rapidly during volatile market conditions, which can cause differences between platforms.

### My swap transaction failed. What happened to my funds?
If a swap fails, your funds are either returned to your wallet or held in a pending state. Check the swap history in the app for details. If funds aren't returned automatically within 24 hours, contact support with your transaction ID.

## Technical Problems

### The app keeps crashing on startup
Try these troubleshooting steps:
1. Force close the app and restart
2. Update to the latest version
3. Restart your device
4. Clear the app cache (Android only)
5. Reinstall the app (your wallet will remain safe if you have your recovery phrase)

### I can't connect to the server
Connection issues can be caused by:
1. Poor internet connectivity
2. Server maintenance (check our social media for announcements)
3. VPN or firewall restrictions
4. Regional access restrictions
